Mathematical Induction is a method of [[Proof|Proving]] [[Theorem|Theorems]] on [[Integer_Number#Natural|Natural Numbers]] but it can be easily generalized into any [[Countable_Set|Countable Set]].

## Principle
The induction states that if
1. Property $P(n)$ holds for $n = 0$
2. $\forall_{n \in \mathbb{N}} \left(P(n) \Rightarrow P(n + 1)\right)$

then $\forall_{n \in \mathbb{N}} P(n)$

Intuitively, imagine falling domino, if $n$-th one falls then $n+1$-th falls, so by pushing $0$-th one, all will fall - in this analogy fallen domino is proved statement.

Note that due to generalization to all countable sets, the starting point as well as the exact implication can be anything, as long as the entire set is covered.
Usually all the challenge is in the second step of induction.

## Axiom



## TODO
- write why it has to be an axiom
- examples
- pitfalls ("proof" about all horses)
