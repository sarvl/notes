Inequation is a statement about [[Inequality]] of two things.


## Polynomial Inequations
[[Polynomial]] inequations are created by joining two polynomials with inequality sign, they can later be solved for range of values for variable that satisfy such inequality, usually in the set of [[Real_Number|Real Numbers]]. Note that [[Polynomial#Complex|Complex Polynomial]] inequations are meaningless.

All polynomial inequations can be transformed into $P(x) \geq 0$ or $P(x) > 0$ by subtracting one side from the other.
Then the solution is to 
1. find polynomial zeros (eg solve [[Equation#Polynomial Equation|Polynomial Equality]])
2. [[Function_Sketching#Polynomial|Polynomial Sketching]] and looking at the graph where $P(x) > 0$

### Operations Permitted
- [[Polynomial#Addition|Polynomial Addition]] of the same polynomial to both sides
- [[Polynomial#Multiplication|Polynomial Multiplication]] of the same polynomial to both sides, requires special care of zero and sign
- [[Polynomial#Division|Polynomial Division]] of the same polynomial to both sides, requires special care of zero and sign


## Rational Functions Inequations
[[Rational_Function|Rational Function]] inequations can be transformed into [[Polynomial]] by
1. removing numbers making any of the denominators zero from the domain
2. subtracting one side from the other yielding $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \geq 0$ or $\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} > 0$ 
3. the answer is $\{x | sign(P(x)) = sign(Q(x))\}$, signs of individual polynomials can be found with [[Function_Sketching#Polynomial|Polynomial Sketching]], in the special case of $deg(P) \leq 1 \land deg(Q) = 1$, the sign can be found much easier by looking at [[Function_Sketching#Homographic|Homographic Sketching]]]]
4. taking [[Set]] Intersection between answer and domain

## Magnitude Inequality
All [[Magnitude]] inequations can be transformed into two or more separate regular inequations with separate domain
Let $f$ and $g$ be the function and let there be inequality $|f(x)| < |g(x)|$ the domain is then divided such that both functions have a constant (not necessarily the same) sign, if a sign is negative replace $f(x)$ with $-f(x)$ and $g(x)$ with $-g(x)$, otherwise simply remove magnitude signs and follow other approaches from this document.
