A type of [[Signal]] processing using analog components, as opposed to [[Digital_Signal_Processing|Digital Signal Processing]].

## Filters
A filter is a circuit removing part of the input, low and high pass filters can be composed to make band-pass and band-stop filters, these four types can then be composed to make even more elaborate filtering.

### Low Pass Filter
Any low pass filter essentially performs [[Integration]] on the signal and so can be implemented with [[Analog_Integrator]].
To see why, 


### High Pass Filter
Any high pass filter essentially performs [[Differentiation]] on the signal and so can be implemented with [[Analog_Differentiator]].
To see why, 

## TODO
- verify connection between LPF and integration, and between HPF and  differentiation
