A transistor is an electrically controlled [[Current_Source|Current Source]]. A transistor is a backbone of modern [[Processor|Processors]], composed in massive quantities on [[Integrated_Circuit|Integrated Circuits]]. Transistor can be thought of as a [[Electrical_Switch|Electrical Switch]] or as an [[Amplifier]], depending on the usecase.

There are 3 main types of transistors
- [[JFET]] 
- [[BJT]]
- [[MOSFET]]  

all three with slightly different behavior and construction, but with the same general idea.

In [[Digital_Electronics|Digital Electronics]] a transistor is just a switch used to create [[Logic_Gate|Logic Gates]] and other components.
