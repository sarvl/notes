A Potentiometer is an adjustable [[Resistor]]

## Construction

Track with relatively high [[Resistance]] is connected by moving [[Conductor]] to another end. By moving the conductor, larger (or smaller) part of the track has to be traversed by [[Current]], increasing (or decreasing) resistance.
As the track can be made from any material or with any width,  there is no limit on maximum current or shape of the function, other than [[Monotonic|Monotonically]] non decreasing.


## Application
For any [[Voltage]] controlled element, can easily create [[Voltage_Divider|Voltage Divider]]
