#electronics #circuit  

As [[Electronic_Device]] diode is device that conducts current in only one direction. Most commonly it is created with [[Semiconductor]]. 

## Ideal Diode

## Real Diode
Generally real diode is described by equation $I = I_S\exp(V_D/V_T)$.

## Large Signal Analysis

### Analytical
### Split into Cases
### Graphical

## Small Signal Analysis
[[Small_Signal|Small Signal]] model of diode can be found by taking derivative around [[Operating_Point|Operating Point]].   
$$g_d = \frac{di_D}{dv_D} = \frac{d}{dv_D} I_S\exp(v_D/V_T) = \frac{I_S\exp(v_D/V_T)}{V_T} = \frac{i_D}{V_T} \approx \frac{I_D}{V_T} $$
